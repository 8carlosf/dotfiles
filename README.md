a simple dotfile manager
------------------------

**Attention**: *install.sh* may overwrite your config files (comment whit # any config that you don't want to install). Be sure to make a backup or import them all (you can use the *import.sh* tool). Enjoy!

**Problems**: if you are installing a config and there is a folder with the same name, the symbolic link with be created inside the folder, you need to remove the folder manualy and then install the config.


Please report any issues and sugestions. Thank you
